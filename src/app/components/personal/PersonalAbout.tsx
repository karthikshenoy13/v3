          Hey there! Beyond the code and corporate projects, I'm someone who believes in 
          exploring the intersection of technology and creativity. I love experimenting 
          with new ideas, building quirky side projects, and learning just for the joy of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not at my desk, you'll find me diving into sci-fi novels, exploring 
          photography, or tinkering with Arduino projects. I'm fascinated by how technology 
          can be playful, artistic, and deeply human.
        </p>

          I believe life is about balance - between logic and creativity, work and play, 
          structure and spontaneity. This space is where I get to be myself, share my 
          passions, and connect with others who see the world a little differently.
